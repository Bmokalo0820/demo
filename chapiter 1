The Analytic Theory of Heat
In 1822, Fourier published his work on heat flow in Th√©orie analytique de la chaleur (The Analytical 
Theory of Heat),[8] in which he based his reasoning on Newton's law of cooling, namely, that the flow
 of heat between two adjacent molecules is proportional to the extremely small difference of their temperatures. 
 This book was translated,[9] with editorial 'corrections',[10] into English 56 years later by Freeman (1878).[11] The book was
 also edited, with many editorial corrections, by Darboux and republished in French in 1888.[10]

There were three important contributions in this work, one purely mathematical, two essentially physical. 
In mathematics, Fourier claimed that any function of a variable, whether continuous or discontinuous, 
can be expanded in a series of sines of multiples of the variable. Though this result is not correct without 
additional conditions, Fourier's observation that some discontinuous functions are the sum of infinite series
 was a breakthrough. The question of determining when a Fourier series converges has been fundamental for centuries. 
 Joseph-Louis Lagrange had given particular cases of this (false) theorem, and had implied that the method was general, 
 but he had not pursued the subject. Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet was the first to give a satisfactory demonstration of 
 it with some restrictive conditions. This work provides the foundation for what is today known as the Fourier transform.

One important physical contribution in the book was the concept of dimensional homogeneity in equations; i.e.
 an equation can be formally correct only if the dimensions match on either side of the equality; Fourier made important 
 contributions to dimensional analysis.[12] The other physical contribution was Fourier's proposal of his partial differential 
 equation for conductive diffusion of heat. This equation is now taught to every student of mathematical physics.
