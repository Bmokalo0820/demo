Even our water is special. It comes from the Cascade Mountain springs that

In his articles, Fourier referred to an experiment by de Saussure, who lined a vase with blackened cork. Into the cork, he inserted 
several panes of transparent glass, separated by intervals of air. Midday sunlight was allowed to enter at the top of the vase through
the glass panes. The temperature became more elevated in the more interior compartments of this device. Fourier concluded that gases in 
the atmosphere could form a stable barrier like the glass panes.[17] This conclusion may have contributed 
to the later use of the metaphor of the "greenhouse effect" to refer to the processes that determine atmospheric temperatures.[21] 
Fourier noted that the actual mechanisms that determine the temperatures of the atmosphere included convection, which was not present 
in de Saussure's experimental device.
 

 Afterwards, Derek tells Danny about his experience in prison, which seems to prompt a change in Danny. 
 The pair return home and remove racist posters from their shared bedroom. The next morning, Danny completes his paper, 
 reflecting on his reasons for adopting neo-Nazi values, and their flaws. Derek walks Danny to school, stopping at a diner 
 for breakfast.
