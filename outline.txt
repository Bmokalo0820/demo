chapter 1
-we meet Nick, Tom, Daisy, and jordanls

In prison, Derek joins the Aryan Brotherhood and befriends a black inmate named Lamont. Derek becomes disgusted and disillusioned 
by prison gang politics; he believes in the ideology, but disapproves of the gang's dealings with non-white gangs and involvement 
in narcotics dealing, thinking that the members are only using the philosophy of white supremacy out of convenience. He loses his 
belief further when his friends in the D.O.C. never visit him in prison. He ultimately abandons the Aryan Brotherhood, who beat 
and rape him in the shower in retaliation. Derek is visited in the hospital wing by Sweeney, with whom he pleads for help to
 get out of prison; promising to leave town and never come back. Sweeney rebukes Derek and reveals his own racist past, much to Derek's 
 shock, and warns that Danny has become involved with the D.O.C. to follow in his footsteps which upsets Derek further. 
 After recovering and leaving the hospital wing, Derek ignores the Aryan Brotherhood while Lamont warns that he may be targeted
  by African-American gangs now that he is no longer under the Aryan Brotherhood's protection. An attack never comes, and Derek 
  spends the remainder of his sentence alone. When he is released, Derek thanks Lamont, whom he realizes intervened on his behalf.
